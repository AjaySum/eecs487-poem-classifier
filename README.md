EECS 487 Final Project: Poetry Classifier
Achyuth Kashyap & Ajay Sumanth
Overview
This Poetry Classifier is a tool designed to assist amateur poets and students in English courses by automatically classifying poems into ten distinct types. The classification includes well-defined forms such as haikus, sonnets, and limericks, as well as more abstract forms like elegies and odes. The goal is to provide a user-friendly tool that aids in learning about poetry and encourages creativity. The classifier takes a text file containing a poem as input and returns the type of poem it classifies.

Usage
To classify a poem, run the main.py script, providing the path to the text file containing the poem as an argument. The classifier will output the type of poem it predicts.
python main.py path/to/poem.txt
